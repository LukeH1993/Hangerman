# Project One

## Purpose
The purpose for this project was to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The decision was made to develop a guessing game called Hangerman, which is a hangman-style game. The name "Hangerman" was a combination of the words "Hungry" and "Anger".

## Functionality
The game begins with an instruction section, informing the user on how to play the game.

Hangerman is available on GitHub from this link: https://lukeh1993.github.io/project-one/

## Implementation
JavaScript was the main language used for functionality. Many methods were implemented using the JQuery library.
