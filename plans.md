# Hangman Game
Missing letters to a word of a particular theme will be displayed on the screen. The player will then have to guess which letters are missing to complete the word. Once a word is complete, the winner will win 100 points. If a letter is guessed incorrectly, the player will lose points, and if the entire hangman is no longer visible on screen, the game will be over.

## Requirements
* The player must be greeted with a instruction section which will inform the player on how to play the game.
* The player's score must be displayed at the end of the game.
* The game needs to be as clean, tidy and clear as possible (without any inperfections!).
* The game will be hosted online.
* Create a README.md file which will document your entire project.
* COMMIT EVERYTHING TO GITHUB, AND DO IT REGULARLY!!! (Aim for 100 commits!)
* Your code needs to be dry and reusable - it can be reused elsewhere in the project.
* Make sure your code is well indented and neatly formatted - make it easy to read and follow.
* Comment everywhere so you know what your code is doing.
* IF YOU GET STUCK, GET HELP FROM SOMEONE IN THE TEAM!
* IF SOMEONE IS STUCK, HELP THEM TOO!

### What I Need To Do...
* Store words in an array. A function will then randomly select words from the array.
* Blank spaces will need be created which will represent that word from the array.
* A function will take the players guesses and will be checked by the program to see if that letter is matched in one of the array words.
* The hangman body will be created in HTML using div's with classes and IDs which will then be styled using CSS. The hangman's functionality will be coded in JS.
* A message will be displayed when a user types an incorrect letter.
* Once the player has 1000 points, they will win and the game will be ended.
* The game should be easy to reset.
* Instructions will need to be clear and relevant to the game.

### What I Could Do...
* Create a leaderboard, where the user can input a name and be displayed on a leaderboard of previous highest scores.
* Animate the hangman and use HTML 5 sound effects.

# Checkers Game
The players will begin the game with 12 pieces, or checkers, placed in the three rows closest to him or her. The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's checkers or position your pieces so that your opponent has no available moves. Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward.

* The player's score must be displayed at the end of the game.

### What I Need To Do...
* The board will be created using div's in HTML.
* When the player captures the other player's checkers, they will score points, and so the other player will lose points.
* The user must be able to move checker pieces around the board. This could be done with a single click.
* The board will use pixels to represent positions.
* At the end of the game, the final scores and winner will be displayed on the screen.
* The game should be easy to reset.
* Instructions will need to be clear and relevant to the game.

### What I Could Do...
* Create a leaderboard, where the user can input a name and be displayed on a leaderboard of previous highest scores.
* Animate the hangman and use HTML 5 sound effects.

### Planning
* Develope a scope that will document what you are planning to do, how you plan to do it, how long each task will take and what features you will include (USE TRELLO!).
* Make a series of wireframes and sketches of how you want your pages to look and how the links will work.
* Make milestones for your project, with suitable deadlines (USE TRELLO!).
